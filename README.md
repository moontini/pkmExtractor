# pkmExtractor
A simple script to extract Pokemon from a sav file. Currently only supporting Gen3 games. 

## TODO 
create a function that easily translates a trainerID block into bytes. 

## Usage
1. open pkmExtractor and edit your trainerID inside the "ID_Blocks" list. 
2. Python pkmExtractor.py
3. use [PkHex](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/) and open a working gen3 save and drag the pkm files (one by one) into your boxes.
